      content="My name is Carlos. I'm a Web and Mobile developer based in Sidney, Australia.
      I am an energetic and curious individual with a global perspective, having lived in France, Portugal, Spain, the US, and now Australia. This diverse experience has enabled me to speak multiple languages and immerse myself in various cultures. Outside of coding, my passions range from exploring nature and surfing to embracing the latest in tech and innovation. Professionally, I'm currently a Full Stack Developer for the Spanish startup, Ciudadela. My expertise revolves around Next JS, React, GraphQL, Apollo, PostgreSQL, and Strapi. Beyond web development, I've delved into mobile app creation and have explored a range of other tech tools."
